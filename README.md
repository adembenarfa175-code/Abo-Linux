# Abo Linux - Project VIP (Value-Integrated Project)

## Version: v1.0.0 (Blueprint Base)

Abo Linux is a minimal, modular, and security-focused Linux distribution built from scratch for the aarch64 architecture (mobile and embedded systems).

### Core Features:
- **Custom Toolchain:** Built with Binutils, GCC, and Glibc targeting aarch64-lfs-linux-gnu.
- **Custom Security:** Features the Abo-Guard (C daemon) for low-level integrity checks.
- **Custom Build System:** Uses 15+ custom shell utilities (mkfhs, apka, etc.) for full control over the build process.

## Branch VIP Focus:
The 'VIP' branch is dedicated to massive, disruptive, and non-stable updates, including:
1. Integration of Glibc and the full cross-toolchain.
2. Porting the ZRBL Bootloader logic to Aarch64.
3. Development of the APKA package format.
